# Depression and SSDI Applications Among Older Adults
## Overview

This study examines the relationship between depression and applications for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) among U.S. adults aged 65 and older. The goal is to better understand how mental health may influence engagement with public benefit programs.

## Research Question

Is depression associated with fewer SSDI applications among eligible older adults?

## Hypothesis

Older adults with depression apply for SSDI fewer times than individuals without depression.

## Background

Prior research on depression highlights its association with loneliness, persistent sadness, and reduced motivation. These factors may discourage individuals—even those who are qualified—from initiating or completing SSDI applications. As a result, mental health challenges could act as a barrier to accessing disability benefits.

## Significance

Understanding this relationship is important for:

Identifying potential gaps in access to SSDI benefits

Informing policy discussions around mental health and social support systems

Highlighting the need for targeted assistance for older adults with depression

## Scope

Population: U.S. adults aged 65 and older

Focus: Depression status and SSDI application behavior
